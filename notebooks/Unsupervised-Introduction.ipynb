    "# Unsupervised Learning - An introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabelled data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden structures or patterns in the data. Techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction are strongly related and user in unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "While dimension reduction aims to make high-dimensional data manageable, clustering seeks to find the boundary for differentiation within the data. Common dimension reduction techniques are principal component analysis (PCA), based on linear transformation. The goal is to find the desired number of components by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data.\n",
    "Other methods include Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE). Dimensionality reduction is often used in machine learning to visualize high dimensional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering on the other hand tries to optimize a number of cluster centroids on the data to describe it as groups. Clustering can be used to find shared characteristics in features or classify the data into classes (or groups). There is a number of different types of clustering methods. Connectivity models, centroid models, distribution models or density models. Well known clustering methods are KMeans, DBSCAN or MeanShift."

    "The basic goal of the autoencoder is to find an accurate low dimensional representation of the input $x_{i}$, be learning to encode $g_{\\phi}$ and decode $f_{\\phi}$ the input to latent space (latent code) and reverse decode this latent representation back to the input. The training goal is to obtain good reconstructions from the original input. If that's the case the encoder ($g_{\\phi}$) can compress the input feature, while the decoder ($f_{\\phi}$) can reconstruct the input ($x'$). After training the encoder can be used to find good low dimensional representations from the input space, for classification or other tasks. Whereas the decoder can be used to generate outputs from low dimensional inputs (a fundamental concept to Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs)).\n",
